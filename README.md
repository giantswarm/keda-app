# keda chart

Giant Swarm offers a keda App which can be installed in workload clusters.

## Installing

There are several ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

- [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/app-platform/#installing-an-app).
- By creating an [App resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) in the management cluster as explained in [Getting started with App Platform](https://docs.giantswarm.io/app-platform/getting-started/).

## Upgrading keda version

The content of the `helm` folder are being generated by the `make` target called `make update-chart`.

This target uses [`vendir`](https://carvel.dev/vendir/) to fetch the helm chart contained in [the fork of the keda repository that we maintain](https://github.com/giantswarm/keda-upstream).
Currently, the state is the following:
- the `main` branch on the fork contains latest upstream release `v2.12.x`, with our custom changes on top unreleased yet (TO BE 2.x).
- the `giantswarm/v2.11.x` branch contains latest upstream release `v2.11.x`, with our custom changes on top unreleased yet (TO BE 1.x).
- the `giantswarm/v2.10.x` branch contains latest upstream release `v2.10.x`, with our custom changes on top released in keda-app 0.x.

### Major or minor version upgrade

If you want to upgrade this keda-app to use a newer version of keda, you need to prepare our fork first.

In `keda-upstream`:

1. You need to create a new branch for the previous version (e.g. `giantswarm/v2.12.x` for upstream release `v2.12.x` using `git checkout v2.12.x -b giantswarm/v2.12.x`) and then `cherry-pick` our changes from `main` into it or create the release branch from main (`git checkout main -b giantswarm/v2.12.x`)
2. Update the `main branch` to reflect latest upstream changes (sync fork should suffice).
3. Apply our custom changes on top of that new branch. You can use `cherry-pick` for that.

In `keda-app`:

4. Run the make target `APPLICATION=keda make update-chart && helm-docs helm/keda`
5. Update schema: `helm schema-gen helm/keda/values.yaml > helm/keda/values.schema.json`
6. Create a new pull request in `keda-app` with the generated changes.
If you need further customizations, you can keep adding commits on the new `keda-upstream` branch, and re-run `APPLICATION=keda make update-chart && helm-docs helm/keda` to update the generated files.
Do not forget to review this README.
7. Merge the changes in `keda-app` once you're happy with the changes and you've tested it works in a workload cluster.
8. Release a new major version of our `keda app`

### Patch version upgrade

If you want to upgrade this keda-app to use a newer version of keda, you need to prepare our fork first.

In `keda-upstream`:

1. Go the the branch of the version you want to patch (e.g. `giantswarm/v2.10.x`).
2. Fetch latest tags from upstream: `git fetch --tags upstream` with upstream pointing to the upstream keda repository
3. Rebase the upstream tag (`git rebase -i <tag>`)

In `keda-app`:

4. Run the make target `APPLICATION=keda make update-chart && helm-docs helm/keda` in the correct release branch (`0.x for keda 2.10`)
5. Update schema: `helm schema-gen helm/keda/values.yaml > helm/keda/values.schema.json`
6. Create a new pull request in `keda-app` with the generated changes.
If you need further customizations, you can keep adding commits on the new `keda-upstream` branch, and re-run `APPLICATION=keda make update-chart && helm-docs helm/keda` to update the generated files.
7. Merge the changes in `keda-app` once you're happy with the changes and you've tested it works in a workload cluster.
8. Release a new major version of our `keda app`
